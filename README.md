To play sounds you need to choose where you want to save your music and than just push 'letter buttons' on your keyboard. You can also load music from a file, we made "test.txt" and "plug_in_baby.txt" as examples, but obviously you can also load music that you previously made. Files .wav are currently not supported, but we'll add this option soon.
